## About the app
For many people, interacting with public institutions is difficult because of the complex procedures in place. **Primăria Digital** is a tool that wants to help the citizens by removing the bureaucracy and assisting them in their interaction with different public institutions.

## Functionality & Target audience
**Primăria Digital** translates the functionality of a town hall into the digital environment oversimplifying the bureaucratic procedures. In order to interact with the city hall, the individual can access **Primăria Digital** application for proper information on specific procedures.

**Primăria Digital** is addressed to natural persons, citizens of a European Economic Area (EEA) state, in accordance with the provisions of Romanian Law 544/2001 on access to information of public interest.

## Algorithmics
**Primăria Digital** is a C++, console based application that uses well defined functions for each operation presented to the end user. The app uses user text input to determine what information is requested and either displays predefined information, downloads pdf forms or accesses the internet.

The 1st tier functions are used to display relevant information for each specific operation. The actual information is read by the application via a text file (primarie.txt), that is easily editable by each administrator.  
The 2nd tier functions are used to process user input, find relevant terms - keywords for each specific operation and allow the user to execute multiple operations in a single instance run.
